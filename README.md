# Java-Bank-Incomplete-
An ATM banking app that lets a user be able to withdraw and deposit from either their checkings or savings account.

-- Need to write a test statement to test if the user enters in a valid number and nothing else
      a Try/Catch would work for this
-- Need to add Overdraft to charge the user an additional $35 as an Overdraft fee
-- Need to write the Credit method to allow the use of credit at the expense of 0.03% interest
-- Need to write the Loan Method to allow the use of loans
